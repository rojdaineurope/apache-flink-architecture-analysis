# Apache Flink Architecture Analysis

This repository contains the final project report for **Software Architecture** at Ankara Yıldırım Beyazıt University.  
The project provides an in-depth analysis of **Apache Flink** from an architectural perspective.

## 📌 Contents
- Introduction to Apache Flink: purpose, functionality, core features
- Advantages and disadvantages of Apache Flink
- Prescriptive architecture: styles and patterns (Layered, Pipe and Filter, Master-Slave, Event-Driven, Microservices)
- Key components and their interactions (Job Manager, Task Manager, Resource Manager, Dispatcher, Checkpointing, etc.)
- Descriptive architecture analysis:
  - Modularity
  - Coupling
  - Cohesion
- Evaluation of scalability, reliability, and performance
- Code analysis using **SonarQube** and **CodeScene**
- Identification of architectural smells and constraints
- Proposed architectural improvements
